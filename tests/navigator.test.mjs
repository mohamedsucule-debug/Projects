/* tests/navigator.test.mjs — the catalogue and the retrieval behind it.

   Two jobs. The first is that the navigator can never send somebody to a page
   that is not there, which is checked against the actual filesystem rather than
   against my memory of it. The second is that the search behaves like a search
   rather than like a substring filter — that a rare word outranks a common one,
   that a typo still finds the page, and that "I have two minutes" is understood
   as a constraint rather than searched for as words. */

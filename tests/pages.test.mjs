/* tests/pages.test.mjs — the things every page on this site owes the reader.

   Thirty-one pages written over months, each one finished and then left alone.
   Nothing checked that they agreed with each other, so they drifted: six had no
   doctype at all and rendered in quirks mode, decoded as windows-1252, with
   every em-dash and box-drawing character in them mangled; those same six had no
   viewport tag, so a phone laid them out at 980px and shrank the result until
   the text was unreadable.

   None of that throws. None of it fails a unit test of the thing the page is
   about. It is exactly the class of rot that only a sweep catches, so this is
   the sweep, and it runs with everything else. */
